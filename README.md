# 🏥 Lung Cancer Prediction Project

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to develop a **machine learning model** for predicting the likelihood of **lung cancer** based on various patient attributes and risk factors. The model utilizes data preprocessing, feature selection, and predictive modeling techniques to achieve accurate results.

## 📂 Project Structure
### 🚀 Features & Methodology:
#### 1. Data Preprocessing: 
Cleaning and handling missing values.
#### 2. Feature Engineering: 
Selecting key features influencing lung cancer.
#### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualizing patterns and trends.
#### 4. Machine Learning Models: 
Implementing classifiers like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
#### 5. Model Evaluation:
Using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
### 📊 Results & Insights
The models tested included Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Through rigorous 5-fold cross-validation, Logistic Regression emerged as the most suitable model, achieving a mean CV score of 0.8738 ± 0.0057, tied with SVM but chosen for its simplicity, efficiency, and interpretability—key factors in healthcare applications. The results demonstrate that Logistic Regression not only offers high accuracy but also provides robust and consistent predictions, making it a reliable model for early lung cancer detection.
